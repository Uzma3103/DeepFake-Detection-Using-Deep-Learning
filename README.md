# DeepFake-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
WATCH THE DEMO VIDEO OF PROJECT ATTACHED WITH .MP4 EXTENSION
** Overview**
Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media where a person's likeness is replaced with another's. This project aims to detect such manipulations using deep learning techniques to preserve digital integrity and combat misinformation.

** Objective**
To develop a deep learning-based model that can accurately classify real and fake (deepfake) videos or images by identifying facial and spatial anomalies.

**Features**
Face detection and frame extraction from videos.

Image preprocessing for model input.

Deep learning model (e.g., CNN/XceptionNet) for classification.

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualization of results with graphs and confusion matrix.

 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model: CNN / XceptionNet (customizable based on your implementation)

Dataset: FaceForensics++, DFDC, or Celeb-DF

 Output
A trained model that classifies media as Real or Fake, with promising accuracy and potential for real-world integration in content validation tools.

Deepfake detection uses deep learning to identify manipulated media by detecting visual and audio inconsistencies.
Technologies Used: CNNs, XceptionNet, Flask, Tensorflow
